### Case Study: Application Evergreening Component for Java-Based Applications

#### 1. **Introduction**

Managing dependencies in modern Java applications is a critical and time-consuming task, especially when dealing with complex projects that need to remain secure and performant. Manual updates of project dependencies introduce inefficiencies and can delay important releases. To solve this problem, I designed and implemented an **Application Evergreening Component**, which automates the process of updating dependencies across various projects.

This component has been successfully integrated into the **SETS** projects, specifically within the **ATM API**. This API uses the component to perform quarterly updates, focusing heavily on handling **Prisma vulnerability fixes** and reducing manual effort in upgrading dependencies. By leveraging Jenkins pipelines, I have significantly minimized human intervention and enhanced security across various dependencies.

While BAU processes prevent immediate production deployment, this automated system has streamlined the upgrade process in development and testing environments. All changes are subjected to multiple levels of testing and stakeholder approval before reaching production. Through my efforts, we’ve managed to implement this across multiple sets of projects, with substantial success, particularly with the **ATM API**, which now leverages the automation quarterly.

#### 2. **Approach Overview**

##### **Prerequisites:**
Before diving into the actual automation steps, a few essential prerequisites must be set up:
1. The Jenkins pipeline is configured as a batch job that executes based on user-defined input parameters.
2. Input parameters include the branch name, repository name, package manager (Maven/Gradle), Jira link for tracking, stash link for pull requests, and a list of dependencies to exclude or treat as common.

##### **The Steps:**

Here’s a breakdown of how the component works, followed by a visual representation:

1. **Repo Checkout**: The pipeline begins by checking out the repository specified in the input parameters.
   
2. **Jira Ticket Creation**: A Jira ticket is automatically created to document the upgrade process, ensuring visibility and tracking.

3. **Branch Creation**: A new branch is created using the Jira ticket reference. This branch will be used for committing any changes.

4. **Dependency Upgrade Process**:
   - The system identifies which dependencies need upgrading using tools like `mvn versions:display-dependency-updates`.
   - **Spring Boot Parent Dependencies**: The system first attempts to upgrade Spring Boot parent dependencies. It starts with the latest version and iteratively tests until successful or all relevant versions are tried.
     - If tests pass, changes are committed.
     - If tests fail, it moves to the next lower version until success or a baseline is reached.
   - If any dependencies are excluded as per the user input, the system skips them.
   - **Common Dependencies**: For common dependencies specified by the user, the pipeline handles them accordingly.
   - The system upgrades all remaining dependencies as identified in the initial scan.

5. **Pull Request**: Once the upgrades are successful, a pull request is raised in the repository. If no updates are required, the Jira ticket is updated to reflect this.
